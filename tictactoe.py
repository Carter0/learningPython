# Decided to make tictactoe as another fun program to make.
# Could learn something from it.

# Things this game is going to need.
# A three by three board
# Two players, one x and one o
# Three end game conditions, a tie where whole board is full, a win for x, or a win for o
# Will need some way of determining if a player got three in a row
